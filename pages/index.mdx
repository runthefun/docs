*start from scratch, place a 3D component, make it rotate in every direction, listen to a collision event*

### Creating a New World
1. **Log in** at [awe.box](https://awe.box/studio). If you need access, [join the waitlist](https://oncyber.typeform.com/V2earlyaccess) or [ask in Discord](https://discord.gg/NCuAWD4FCz).  
2. Click **WORLDS** (top-left), then **Create from Scratch**.  
3. A new blank template opens in the **Studio** at [awe.box/studio](https://awe.box/studio).  

### Basic Navigation
- **Move:** **WASD** / arrow keys (Shift to move faster, Space/B to move up/down).  
- **Look Around:** Right-click+drag to pan quickly; left-click+drag to rotate.  
- **Zoom:** Mouse wheel or pinch.

### Adding Components
1. In the **+ Add** panel (expanded by default), **drag and drop** items (e.g., a “Mesh”) into your scene.  
2. Adjust settings in **World Items** (right side) by selecting the component, then editing Parameters like color.

### Transforming Components
Select a component to see the gizmo:
- **Move:** Drag colored arrows.  
- **Rotate:** Drag dotted circles.  
- **Scale:** Drag corner dots.

### Behaviors & Collision
- **Add Behaviors** (e.g. “Spin”) from the **Logic** tab, then drag onto a component.  
- **Enable Collision** in the **Collision** menu so avatars can’t pass through it (e.g. set **Rigid Body Type** to “Kinematic”).

### Preview & Navigation
- **Preview:** Click the ▶️ icon at the top to see your world as visitors will.  
- **Desktop:** WASD/arrow keys, Space to jump, Shift to run, ESC to unlock mouse.  
- **Mobile:** Virtual joystick (bottom-left), tap top-right to rotate camera.

### Publishing & Remixing
1. Click the **=** icon (top-center) → **Rename**.  
2. Add a **Title**, **Description**, and **URL** slug, then **Publish**.  
3. (Optional) **Enable Remixing** in **Privacy & Access** if you want others to duplicate your world.
