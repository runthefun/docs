## Avatar Animations

We utilize the [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/) FBX format for our avatar animations. You can download any animation from Mixamo and upload it to our platform. Additionally, we offer a repository of animations for you to explore in the studio.

### 1. Downloading and Uploading Animations:
   - Visit Mixamo, choose an animation, and download it in the .FBX format.
   - In oncyber Studio, navigate to the avatar section on the left, then select Avatar Animations.
   - Upload your animation and rename it for easy access later (either in the avatar menu or through scripting).

### 2. Implementing Avatar Animations in Scripting:

   ```ts
   import { Components, Player } from "@oo/scripting";

   export default class Game {
       onReady = () => {
           // Animate an avatar within the scene
           const avatar = Components.byId("AvatarID");
           avatar.animation = "chickendance";
       }
   }
   ```

## Animating Objects on the Screen (Position, Rotation, etc.)

To smoothly update the position of an object in the scene, use AnimeJS:

   ```ts
   import anime from "animejs";

   onReady = async () => {
        const bus = Components.byId("bus");

        anime({
            targets: bus.position,
            x: -10,
            y: 0,
            z: 0,
            duration: 1000,
        });
   }
   ```

AnimeJS offers a variety of options. For more details, refer to the [Anime.js documentation](https://animejs.com/documentation/).

## General Model Animations

To play or pause animations on a 3D model using scripting:

   ```ts
   import { Components, ModelComponent, seconds } from "@oo/scripting";

   export default class Game {
       onReady = async () => {
           const model = Components.byId('samplemodel') as ModelComponent;
           model.play("GM");
           await seconds(10);
           model.stop("GM");
       }
   }
   ```
