# Importing and Utilizing Built-in Libraries

The scripting environment allows you to import code from other scripts. You can also use some built-in libraries such as Three.js for 3D rendering or Rapier for physics simulations.

This integration enables the creation of more complex and visually appealing games, leveraging well-established web language libraries.

The bulk of the oncyber Scripting API is exposed by **`@oo/scripting`**. This package contains some important global objects that give access to the current game world and its content. For example:

```ts copy
import {  World, Components } from "@oo/scripting"
```

Additionally, the Editor provides access to other useful libraries for various tasks (3D, Physics, UI, etc).

## [Threejs](https://threejs.org/) (3D Graphics)

The oncyber game engine is built on top of the [**Three.js**](https://threejs.org/) library. **Three.js** is a battle-tested JavaScript library used to create and display 3D graphics in a web browser.

You can access the three.js library directly from you script by importing from the **`three`** package. For example:

```ts copy
import { Vector3 } from "three"
```

## [Rapier](https://rapier.rs/docs/) (Physics)

The oncyber game engine handles game physics via the [**Rapier**](https://rapier.rs/docs/) library. **Rapier** is a physics engine written using the Rust programming language, offering efficient simulation of Rigid Body dynamics.

It is optimized for performance, supporting a range of collision shapes and constraints. 

> Note: the oncyber game engine use the webassembly version of Rapier.

You can access Rapier from you script by importing the **`"@dimforge/rapier3d"`** package. For example:

```ts copy
import * as RAPIER from "@dimforge/rapier3d"
```

## [React](https://react.dev/) (UI)

To add UI elements to your game, you can use the [React](https://react.dev/) library. **React** is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly web applications with dynamic, interactive elements.

React emphasizes a component-based architecture, allowing developers to create reusable UI components.

To use React from in scripts, you can import from the `"react"` package. For example:

```ts copy
import * as React from "react"
// or
import { useState } from "react"
```

The code editor supports JSX syntax, so you can create your Components the same way you do in a typical React application. For example:

```tsx copy
function GameTimer({ remainingSeconds }) {

    return <div>{remainingSeconds}s</div>
}
```

As an example of how to render a Component, you can use the same code in the [Getting Started course](getting\_started/#adding-a-timer-and-ending-the-game)

```tsx copy filename="main" {1, 5-8, 11-17, 21, 25, 30-32}
import { UI } from "@oo/scripting"

export default class MyGame {

    maxGameSeconds = 60
    remainingSeconds = 0
    interval;
    renderer = UI.createRenderer();

    onStart = () => {
        this.remainingSeconds = this.maxGameSeconds;
        this.interval = setInterval(() => {
            this.remainingSeconds -= 1;
            this.renderer.render(
                <GameTimer remainingSeconds={this.remainingSeconds} />
            )
        }, 1000)
    }

    onDispose = () => {
        clearInterval(this.interval)
    }

    onEnd = () => {
        clearInterval(this.interval)
    }

}

function GameTimer({ remainingSeconds }) {
    return <div>{remainingSeconds}s</div>
}
```

## [AnimeJS](https://animejs.com/) (Animation)

We also provide access to [AnimeJS](https://animejs.com/). AnimeJS is a robust JavaScript library that can be used to animate pretty much anything (3D models, UI elements, etc).

You can import it from the `"AnimeJS"` package. For example:

```ts copy
import anime from "animejs"
```
