# Interacting with the PlayerControls Component from Code

If one of your scripts needs to interact with the PlayerControls component directly, you access certain settings through code.

The following example shows how to activate and deactivate the controls:

```ts copy filename="main" {1, 6-9}
import PlayerControls from "./PlayerControls"

export default class Game {

    onReady = () => {
        const playerControls = PlayerControls.getMain();
        playerControls.active = false;
        playerControls.active = true;
    }
}
```

In the example above, we import the PlayerControls component, get its main instance, and set the booleans (true/false values) for whether the controls are active or not.

At the moment, the PlayerControls component only exposes a few settings through code, like enabling and disabling the controls.

However, we can access the [inner controls](../reference/platformercontrolswrapper.md) for additional options.

```ts copy filename="main" {1, 6-9}
import PlayerControls from "./PlayerControls"

export default class Game {

    onReady = () => {
        const platformerControls = PlayerControls.getMain().controls;
        // prevent the controls from animating the avatar
        platformerControls.autoAnimate = false;
        // more soon
    }
}
```

> Note: the autoAnimate setting in the code example above can also be found and set as a frontend toggle -- however, the available inner controls settings may differ for the platformer and platformer2 ControlsMode.

For additional flexibility and customization, you also edit the code for the default PlayerControls component in the Script Editor, or even create your own [custom controls](../controls/custom.md) from scratch.
