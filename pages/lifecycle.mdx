## Lifecycle Overview

In awe, **Scripts**, **Components** and **Behaviors** have special lifecycle methods that run at key moments:

```ts copy filename="main"
export default class GameManager {
  elapsedTime = 0;
  maxGameTime = 10;

  onStart() {
    this.elapsedTime = 0;
  }

  // this is what you often hear as the game loop
  // it will run at every frame, eg. 60fps means this runs 60 times / second
  onUpdate(dt: number) {
    this.elapsedTime += dt;
  }
}
```

### `onPreload()`
Runs before asset loading; ideal for async setup or resource definitions.

### `onReady()`
Called after all assets load. Put **one-time** initializations here.

### `onStart()`
Triggers each time the game starts. Good for resetting positions, timers, etc.

### `onUpdate(dt)`
Runs every frame. `dt` is elapsed time since last frame. Handle movement, collision, and real-time logic here.

### `onPause()` / `onResume()`
- **Pause**: Stop animations/timers.  
- **Resume**: Reactivate paused elements.

### `onEnd()`
Runs when the game ends (e.g., after `World.stop()`).

### `onDispose()`
The final cleanup hook after a session ends. Release or unsubscribe resources here.

Use these methods to manage your gameâ€™s flow and keep logic organized and responsive.
