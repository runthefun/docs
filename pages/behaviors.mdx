## Behaviors

**What Are Behaviors?**  
Behaviors are reusable scripts that attach directly to existing Components in awe. They let you add extra logic (e.g. rotation, interaction) without creating new Components.

---

## Minimal Example

1. **Create a new script** with:
   ```ts
   import { ScriptBehavior } from '@oo/scripting'

   export default class ExampleBehavior extends ScriptBehavior {}
   ```
2. To **attach it**, drag and drop onto a component or item in the list or select any Component in the Studio (**World Items** panel), click “+” → choose a Behavior

> **Note:** You **cannot** delete a script if its Behavior is still attached to a scene object.

---

### Adding Actions

For a simple rotation, add `onUpdate`:

```ts
onUpdate(dt: number) {
  this.host.rotation.y += 0.5 * dt;
}
```

- **`this.host`** refers to the attached Component.  
- Behaviors support other lifecycle methods like `onStart` or `onDispose`.

---

### Adding Collisions

For a simple collision, add `handleCollisionEnter`:

```ts
handleCollisionEnter(event: CollisionEvent) {
  console.log("Collision detected!");
}
```

> **Note:** Collision settings defined on parent components take precedence over those defined in behaviors. So when using the GUI editor, ensure that collisions are enabled only on the behavior script and not the parent component.

---

## Frontend Customization (Parameters)

Expose settings to the Studio UI using params:

```ts
import { ScriptBehavior, $Param as P } from '@oo/scripting'

export default class SpinBehavior extends ScriptBehavior {
  speed = P.Number(0.5);

  onUpdate(dt: number) {
    this.host.rotation.y += this.speed * dt
  }
}
```

Users can now adjust `speed` in the Inspector.

[See all available param types](https://docs.awe.box/reference/param#parameters)

---

### Organizing Studio UI with Folders

Use `@Folder` to group parameters:

```ts
import { ScriptBehavior, $Param as P, Folder } from '@oo/scripting'

export default class ExampleBehavior extends ScriptBehavior {
  @Folder("Rotation Settings")
  speed = P.Number(0.5, { step: 0.1 });

  @Folder("Extra")
  color = P.Color("#ffffff");
}
```

---

### Config

You can add descriptive metadata:

```ts
static config = {
  title: "Spin Behavior",
  description: "Rotates the attached component",
  tip: "Adjust speed as desired",
}
```
